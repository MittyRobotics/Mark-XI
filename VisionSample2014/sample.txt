FRC 2014 Vision Sample Program
--------------------------------
This project is a camera vision sample that detects the vision targets in
the 2014 FRC game. Look at the comments in the code and the Vision Processing section of the
documentation at http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com. Look in the VisionImages directory
inside the project that is created for sample images.
