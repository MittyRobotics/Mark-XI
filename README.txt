TKO 1351's Mark XI Robot Code (2014)

Thanks for cloning this repository!
IMPORTANT: Make sure to set your gitignore_global.txt file TO THE ONE PROVIDED IN THIS REPOSITORY
    If you are using SourceTree, go to Tools > Options > Git > Global Ignore List: and set it to the one in your cloned repository.

Once you have cloned the repository to some folder (eg. mark-xi), set your Windriver workspace to that folder.
    Ex: If cloned to D:\Repositories\Mark-XI, set D:\Repositories\Mark-XI as your workspace when you start Windriver (or press File > Switch Workspace) 
    
Since the repository is not going to take Windriver project files or compiled programs, you are going to need to reimport a local project.
    Select File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace, and press Next
    Click Browse, and without selecting anything, press OK.
    Projects should appear in the "Projects:" box.
    Press Finish to add the projects.
