IMPORTANT: Make sure to set your gitignore_global.txt file TO THE ONE PROVIDED IN THIS REPOSITORY

1)
    Once you have cloned the repository to some folder (eg. mark-xi), set your Windriver workspace to that folder.
    Example: Cloned to D:\Repositories\Mark-XI    When you start Windriver (or press File, Switch Workspace) set D:\Repositories\Mark-XI as your workspace.
    
2)
    Since the repository is not going to take Windriver project files or compiled programs, you are going to need to recreate a local project.
