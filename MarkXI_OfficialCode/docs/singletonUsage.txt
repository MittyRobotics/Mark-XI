To use the singletons in your own class (for example, the gyro)
	1) Include the header file (#include /components/TKOGyro.h) in your class.
	2) DO NOT make any instances of the class (eg. TKOGyro *gyroInst;) and do not worry about initializing the gyro.
	3) Wherever you want to call a gyro function, simply call TKOGyro::inst()->blahblahfunction()
		a) Do not call any singleton functions in the constructor of your class, as this is dangerous and could cause exceptions
		
For every singleton class (ex. class C), add the following code:
// in C.h
class C : public SensorBase
// under private
	DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN(C);
// in C.cpp
C:C() {
	//constructor
	AddToSingletonList();
}
C:~C() {
	// deconstructor
	_instance = NULL;
}
